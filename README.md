# Project Two
by Andrew Bernarte

# Overview
This is a project that showcases the lyrics of a song that means "community" to us as individuals. Certain words in these lyrics we feel to be the closest to what we believe "community" is will be highlighted as navigation through the webpage continues.

# Technical Details
The main methods used in this project are the use of HTML and CSS inside Visual Studio Code, and also making use of the GitHub repository with the use of checking on the GitHub website itself to ensure that the changes inside VSC will be updated after pushing to the origin using GitHub Desktop.
