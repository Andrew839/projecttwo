<p>I'm staring out into the night<br>
   Trying to hide the pain<br>
   I'm going to the place where love<br>
   And feeling good don't ever cost a thing<br>
   And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain<br> 
</p>
<p>
    Well, I'm going home<br>
    Back to the place where I belong<br>
    And where your love has always been enough for me<br>
    I'm not running from<br>
    No, I think you got me all wrong<br>
    I don't regret this life I chose for me<br>
    But these places and these faces are getting old<br>
    So I'm going home<br>
</p>
